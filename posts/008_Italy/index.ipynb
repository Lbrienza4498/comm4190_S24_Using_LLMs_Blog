    "# My Dream Italian Getaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "After my graduation in May, I have a celebratory trip planned with my two sisters to the motherland, Italy! However, the only things we have booked are our roundtrip flights from JFK to Milan. Since we are planning on doing a multi-city trip, incorporating Milan, Lake Camo, Portofino, and the Amalfi Coast, our heads are all spinning on how we are going to find the time to plan. With me still being in school and my sisters working, it's hard to carve out the time to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I put my thinking cap on (kinda) and decided to ask AI for help. Similar to the example we were shown in class, where we used AI to replace a Starbucks barista, I want to use an AI tool and ask it to simulate a travel agent. The goal is to maximize our amount of time in each city while also finding lodging and recommendations that accommodate our interests in nightlife and proximity to the beach when applicable. \n"

    "\n",
    "Certainly! As your travel agent, I've taken your tentative itinerary and made some adjustments to optimize your time in each location while considering your interests in nightlife and proximity to the beach. Here's the updated itinerary:\n",

    "<img src = \"lakecomo.jpeg\" width=\"300px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, this was okay, but I wanted some additional arrangements. I wanted Claude to make specific recommendations for daily activities in each place as well as restaurant and bar recommendations. Also, please keep in mind we would have to return to Milan the night of the 21st as our flight is out of Milan on 6/22 at noon. \n",
